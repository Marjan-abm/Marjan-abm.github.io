                                    We are going to step into the shoes of this old timey retro video store owner and build for ourselves a Video Store API to handle the back end.
                                    The full functionality is spelled out further in the "Project Directions" files (linked below). At a high-level, our goal is to create a 
                                    video store API with the following minimum functionality.</p>

                                    bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!
                                    If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have 
                                    access to the Internet and our API is running!.</p>

                                    each person could swap one of their things with another person's things.For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. 
                                    Also, they should list an inventory list of things.You envision an app where vendors can swap items between different inventories. But what would that backend logic look like?
                                    For this project, given some features that the vendors want, create a set of classes, following the directions below. The directions will lead 
                                    you to create many class definitions, their attributes and instance methods, and some other cool features. Vendors will be able to swap their top item and swap items by category!</p>
